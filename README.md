# NYC Taxi Trip Analysis: End-to-End ELT Pipeline with BigQuery, dbt & Power BI

![Power BI Dashboard](BI%20files/NYC%20Yellow%20Taxi%20Trip%20Insights-1.png)


## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline using **Google BigQuery**, **dbt (data build tool)**, and **Power BI** to analyze New York City yellow taxi trip data. The goal is to clean, model, and visualize data efficiently to uncover useful insights.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Data Source**:
   - Raw CSV files of NYC Yellow Taxi trips (2023) from the public dataset or local upload.

2. **Google BigQuery**:
   - Raw data uploaded to a table: `raw`
   - Zone lookup table: `taxi_zone_lookup`

3. **dbt Transformations**:
   - **Staging Layer (`stg_yellow_trips`)**:
     - Cleans and renames raw columns.
   - **Dimensional Models**:
     - `fact_trips`: Contains all numeric trip data for aggregation.
     - `dim_datetime`: Breaks down pickup timestamps into components.
     - `dim_zones`: Normalizes location IDs to zone names.
   - **Tests & Documentation**:
     - Applied dbt tests for `not null`, `unique`, and `accepted values`.
     - Created `schema.yml` files for all models.

4. **Power BI**:
   - Connected to BigQuery using connector.
   - Created multiple interactive charts and a unified dashboard.

## 🧱 Dimensional Models

- **fact_trips**:
  - Key metrics: trip counts, fare, tip, tolls, distance, etc.
  - Foreign keys: `PULocationID`, `DOLocationID`, `payment_type`

- **dim_datetime**:
  - Columns: hour, day, week, month, year, day_name
  - Primary key: datetime

- **dim_zones**:
  - Columns: Borough, Zone, service_zone
  - Primary key: zone_id

---

## 📊 Power BI Visualizations

- **Trip Count by Hour**: Line chart to show peak times.
- **Fare vs Total Amount**: Bar/line chart comparison.
- **Payment Methods**: Pie chart with legend values mapped (e.g., 1 = Credit Card).
- **Trip Distance vs Passenger Count**: Scatter plot.
- **Trips by Service Zones**: Bar chart.

## ✅ Features Implemented

- Raw data ingestion to BigQuery.
- dbt project with modular SQL models and reusable macros.
- Data quality enforced using dbt tests.
- Schema documentation autogenerated via dbt.
- Interactive dashboard published in Power BI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyc-taxi-elt-pipeline.git
```

2. Upload the raw dataset to BigQuery.

3. Set up dbt profiles and run:

```bash
dbt run
```

4. Connect Power BI to BigQuery and create dashboards.

## 🧠 Learnings & Concepts

1. ELT vs ETL: Using BigQuery as a transformation engine.

2. dbt: Version-controlled, testable, and documented SQL workflows.

3. Dimensional Modeling: Fact and dimension separation for analytics.

4. Power BI: Data visualization best practices and data mapping.
