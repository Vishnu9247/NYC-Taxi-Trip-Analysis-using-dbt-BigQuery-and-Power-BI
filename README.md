## NYC Taxi Trip Analysis: End-to-End ELT Pipeline with BigQuery, dbt & Power BI



### 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline using Google BigQuery, dbt (data build tool), and Power BI to analyze New York City yellow taxi trip data. The goal is to clean, model, and visualize data efficiently to uncover useful insights.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

Tool

Purpose

Google BigQuery

Cloud data warehouse for scalable data storage & querying

dbt

SQL-based transformation tool for data modeling, testing

Power BI

Business Intelligence for creating dashboards & reports

🏗️ Architecture

Data Source:

Raw CSV files of NYC Yellow Taxi trips (2023) from the public dataset or local upload.

Google BigQuery:

Raw data uploaded to a table: raw

Zone lookup table: taxi_zone_lookup

dbt Transformations:

Staging Layer (stg_yellow_trips):

Cleans and renames raw columns.

Dimensional Models:

fact_trips: Contains all numeric trip data for aggregation.

dim_datetime: Breaks down pickup timestamps into components.

dim_zones: Normalizes location IDs to zone names.

Tests & Documentation:

Applied dbt tests for not null, unique, and accepted values.

Created schema.yml files for all models.

Power BI:

Connected to BigQuery using connector.

Created multiple interactive charts and a unified dashboard.

🧱 Dimensional Models

fact_trips:

Key metrics: trip counts, fare, tip, tolls, distance, etc.

Foreign keys: PULocationID, DOLocationID, payment_type

dim_datetime:

Columns: hour, day, week, month, year, day_name

Primary key: datetime

dim_zones:

Columns: Borough, Zone, service_zone

Primary key: zone_id

📊 Power BI Visualizations

Trip Count by Hour: Line chart to show peak times.

Fare vs Total Amount: Bar/line chart comparison.

Payment Methods: Pie chart with legend values mapped (e.g., 1 = Credit Card).

Trip Distance vs Passenger Count: Scatter plot.

Trips by Service Zones: Bar chart.

✅ Features Implemented

Raw data ingestion to BigQuery.

dbt project with modular SQL models and reusable macros.

Data quality enforced using dbt tests.

Schema documentation autogenerated via dbt.

Interactive dashboard published in Power BI.

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyc-taxi-elt-pipeline.git

Upload the raw dataset to BigQuery.

Set up dbt profiles and run:

dbt run

Connect Power BI to BigQuery and create dashboards.

🧠 Learnings & Concepts

ELT vs ETL: Using BigQuery as a transformation engine.

dbt: Version-controlled, testable, and documented SQL workflows.

Dimensional Modeling: Fact and dimension separation for analytics.

Power BI: Data visualization best practices and data mapping.
